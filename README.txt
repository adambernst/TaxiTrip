    - the other .html files contain the webpages that follow index.html, and are all
      linked to app.js and styles.cs

- styles.css: This css file includes all of the formatting and styles for the webpage.

- app.js: This javascript file uses a canvas to create the graph seen on the site, 
          and it allows for the interaction of the sliders with the graph.
